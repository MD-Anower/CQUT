transmission, communciation of signal digital, bit-stream, 
routing, find and search path for multipath scenarios, how to reach the optimal path is critical, optimal in which sense either in shortest distance/delay, or lowest cost/fare, or lowest traffic and congestion, ...

link management
1. multi-users competing for shared transmission media during access, starting
2. on-the-fly link management, means session already active, link/resources/status should be kept alive and hold until session finish

negotiating by protocol TCP/IP, defining the rules/syntax/format for communication/networking
regulating: for example video/voice session, user require high QoS, network path/resource limit has constraints, mismatch happen, you drive car and find many cars on streets, regulating the traffic management, flow/traffic control

managing the network functions/services/devices/links, for example China Mobile, Chine Telecom, Unicom

profiling - profile define levels of services for users/devices/links, for example, monthly plan -- corresponding to profiling

self-healing - means the networks will seperate the failing/broken parts/modules, still functions

scalability flexbility - computer networks can scale and very flexible compared to traditional telecom networks outdated

QoS quality of service, describe service level, which sense, for example, call acceptance rate should high, call rejection rate should low, signal/noise ratio should high, ...

fairness - access fairness link MAC multi-user, load fairness using network resources for public networks except dedicated/private network/link, service based on level/profiling/priority

reliability - overall network still function no matter individual device/component failing

heterogeneous means different hetero- English prefix 
but even with heterogeneous devices/components, network still function because common protocol/interface

network complexity, including network elements/devices/components/modules, hardware/software, link/path/route/service/profiles/security/permission
